# SRE Culture

Requirements (they are intimately related) :
- Trust. Depending on the cultures, it can be difficult to confess mistakes for fear of reprisals. Ultimately, it is important to collect all the data to identify each problem quickly. To achieve this, it is necessary to build a culture of trust.
- Respect. Take for granted that our colleagues are in good faith and that they there for the right reasons.
- Drive decision using and discussion on disagreement using datas.
- [Value stream mapping](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_stream_mapping). Organisations should care about.
- Innovation culture. Working on getting job done is as important as working on creating tools and habits to get more time to get job done better and faster.
- Embracing risk. No systems is perfect. We should care about clients perception. Then don't promise something impossible like having 100% on reliability. For example, when they use cell phone, clients accept less reliability on SaaS because they know troubles are more frequently their carriers signal. Insted, have at least as an SLO that clients couldnt make difference between certain level of reliability and 100% reliability.
